# Internationalisation (i18n)

Translations are extracted from code using [Format JS](http://formatjs.io). You
can read more about the
[Application Workflow](https://formatjs.io/docs/getting-started/application-workflow)
on their website. Run the extraction as follows:

```shell
npm run i18n:extract
```

The app expects to import compiled translations, which can be created as such:

```shell
npm run i18n:compile
```

The workflow to use messages other than English is not finalised. Typically, it
is expected that a developer will not need translations locally. If they do a
command of the sort `npm run i18n:download` will be provided. In production,
translations should be injected into the application at runtime in order that
they can be updated without needing to rebuild the Docker container.
